#Hosting a Telegram Bot on the ESP8266 

An Arduino IDE library around the Telegram Bot API to be used with ESP8266.

----------

## Introduction

This library provides an interface for [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). It is written using Arduino IDE and works using ESP8266.

----------

##Installing

You can download the library [here](https://github.com/omseven/ESP8266/tree/master/Libraries/ESPTelegramBot).

You can include a new .ZIP library into the Arduino IDE by selecting the menu: **Sketch / include Library / Add .Zip library**. 
You also have to install the [Arduino JSON](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) library from the [library manager](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc3).

----------

##Getting started

First thing to do is to create a new bot.

Be sure you have installed [Telegram](https://telegram.org/apps) on your phone or your laptop, then, in the search bar, look for [@botfather](https://telegram.me/botfather).

Talk to him and use the **/newbot** command to create a new bot. The BotFather will ask you for a **name** and **username**, then generate an authorization **token** for your new bot.

The **Name** of your bot will be displayed in contact details and elsewhere.

The **Username** is a short name, to be used in mentions and telegram.me links. Your bot's username must end in ‘bot’, e.g. ‘tetris_bot’ or ‘TetrisBot’.   [See more ...](https://core.telegram.org/bots)

Now that we have our new bot we can set it to do what we want.

In this example we will make it turn on and off a LED by texting him a simple '**/ledon** or **/ledoff** ' message.
